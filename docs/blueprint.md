# **App Name**: CDSH DAO Governance Simulator

## Core Features:

- DAO Dashboard: Display a list of active DAO proposals with key details such as title, deadline, and current status.
- Proposal Details: Show detailed information for a selected proposal, including description, budget impact, voting options (Yes/No/Abstain), and an embedded discussion thread simulator.
- Voting Simulation: Allow users to connect their wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect) to simulate the voting process, including token allocation and confirmation.
- AI-Powered Proposal Summaries: Use a generative AI tool to generate brief summaries of the pros and cons of each proposal based on the description and discussion thread.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep indigo (#3F51B5), drawing from the sense of authority, knowledge, and trust often associated with DAO governance.
- Background color: A very light indigo (#EDEDFF), which provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for the UI elements, while retaining the sense of trust and authority provided by the indigo hue.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#9C27B0) which is analogous to indigo but significantly different in brightness and saturation, and is reserved for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Maintain CDSH's existing typography for brand consistency.
- Employ SVG icons to represent tokens, dashboard elements, and voting options, maintaining a clean and scalable design.
- Adopt Material Design 3 principles for consistent and responsive layouts across all screens.
- Incorporate subtle animations for vote confirmations, wallet connection states, and loading indicators to enhance user feedback.
